\TODO{Twitter API for test data?}
\subsection{Training data}
The training data for machine learning classifiers was created by Go et al. and consists of 1.6 million tweets \cite{GoBHaHua2009}. The tweets were parsed using the Twitter API by querying for positive or negative emoticons, such as ":)" and labeled as positive or negative depending on the emoticon. Furthermore, tweets containing both a negative and positive emoticon, as well as retweets were removed.

This resulted in 800,000 positive and 800,000 negative tweets that were periodically requested on no specific topic, thus covering a huge amount of topics.


\subsection{Filtering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item StringToWordVector
    \item Amount of words + dictionary
    \item Occurences minimum
    \item N-Gram?
    \item lowercase
    \item Binary vs. NumWords
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Classification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison Classifiers --> Accuracy? Runtime (Complexity)
    \item ARFF
    \item maybe experiment with number of training tweets?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Evaluation}
