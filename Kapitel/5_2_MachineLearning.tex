\section{Machine Learning based Method}


\subsection{Training data}
The training data for machine learning classifiers was created by Go et al. and consists of 1.6 million tweets \cite{GoBHaHua2009}. The tweets were parsed using the Twitter API by querying for positive or negative emoticons, such as ":)" and labeled as positive or negative depending on the emoticon. Furthermore, tweets containing both a negative and positive emoticon, as well as retweets were removed.

This resulted in 800,000 positive and 800,000 negative tweets that were periodically requested on no specific topic, thus covering a huge amount of topics.
