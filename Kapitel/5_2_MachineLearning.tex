\section{Machine Learning based Method}

For the machine learning method, WEKA, developed at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, was chosen as the library. As described by Witten et al., "[t]he WEKA workbench is a collection of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing tools [...]" \cite[p.~7]{weka}. It also includes tools for the entire process of data mining, such as preparation of data and evaluation. WEKA is implemented in Java, the version of the library used in this thesis was 3.9.6. Although it also offers a graphical interface only the Java library was used in this thesis \cite{weka}. Weka was chosen because of its large collection of both algorithms and tools for data mining, as well as ease of use through an extensive documentation.

Weka uses the Attribute-Relation File Format for its data, which contains a header describing the attributes, as well as the data itself, with one row containing one instance \cite{weka}. For this thesis, the class attribute was chosen to be nominal, either negative (-1.0) or positive (1.0), for a binary classification problem. Furthermore, the tweet text is added as a string attribute.

\subsection{Training data}
The training data for machine learning classifiers was created by Go et al. and consists of 1.6 million tweets \cite{GoBHaHua2009}. The tweets were parsed using the Twitter API by querying for positive or negative emoticons, such as ":)" and labeled as positive or negative depending on the emoticon. Furthermore, tweets containing both a negative and positive emoticon, as well as retweets were removed \cite{GoBHaHua2009}.

This resulted in 800,000 positive and 800,000 negative tweets that were periodically requested on no specific topic, thus covering a large number of topics \cite{GoBHaHua2009}.

\TODO{delete parts that are methodology, only specifics/implementation details.}

\subsection{Tokenization}
For Tokenization, weka's NGramTokenizer was used, which splits a text into Ngrams of a certain size. The default delimiters, such as whitespace and "\textbackslash n", were used for splitting. The minimum size of the Ngram was set to 1 to include Unigrams, and the maximum size was set to 2 to include Bigrams \cite{weka}.
\subsection{Stop Word Filtering}
For Stop Word Filtering, both a list and a dynamic approach were used. A short list of common words such as "the" was manually collected and evaluated. To further reduce the word size, a limit was set for how often a word has to appear to be included, as well as a (soft) limit of total words. In the testing, a limit of 15,000 words was found to be optimal, with words appearing at least 20 times in the training data. This allowed for the greatest balance of performance and accuracy. This limit was set in weka's StringToWordVector, which is explained in more detail later.

\subsection{Stemming}
For stemming, weka's LovinsStemmer was used, which is based on the Lovins Stemmer \cite{weka}. This stemmer uses a two-step method, which first removes the ending, thus obtaining the stem. After this, similar stems are combined to account for different spellings. An example of this is "absorption", whose stem is "absorpt", while "absorbing" will result in "absorb"\cite{Lovins1968DevelopmentOA}.

\subsection{Vectorization}
In order to transform the text of a tweet into a suitable format for classifiers, weka's StringToWordVector filter is used. This filter transforms the string feature, the tweet's text, by parsing each word out of it using the previously defined NGramTokenizer. The words are then added to a dictionary, which stores all recognized words. In the data, the words are implemented as numeric attributes, with the value denoting the number of occurrences or its presence \cite{weka}.

For example, the tweet "i love it" would result in three attributes, the attribute "i", the attribute "love", and the attribute "it", as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:arff_train}. The dictionary, and with it the attributes, are all determined by the training data. The test data set is also filtered, but only using the known words from the training data, no new words are added to the dictionary \cite{weka}.

\subsection{Training}
For training, Weka's FilteredClassifier was used, which combines an arbitrary filter with an arbitrary classifier. The classifier classes used were "NaiveBayes" for Gaussian Naive Bayes, "NaiveBayesMultinomial", "Logistic" for Logistic Regression, "LibSV"M for Support Vector Machine and "RandomForest" \cite{weka}. For the Support Vector Machine, the LibSVM library had to be added to the project, as Weka only provided a wrapper class \cite{Chang2001}. Once a classifier was built, its file was saved. RandomForest resulted in large files, with the largest being 471 megabytes. For the evaluation, Weka's Evaluation class was used, which automatically calculated all needed measures \cite{weka}.
