abstract = {Sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment-related information from text. Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tasks, such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, RunnersWorld, BBCForums) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.},

        abstract = {Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers organisations and individuals a fast and effective way to monitor the publics' feelings towards them and their competitors. To assess the performance of sentiment analysis methods over Twitter a small set of evaluation datasets have been released in the last few years. In this paper we present an overview of eight publicly available and manually annotated evaluation datasets for Twitter sentiment analysis. Based on this review, we show that a common limitation of most of these datasets, when assessing sentiment analysis at target (entity) level, is the lack of distinctive sentiment annotations among the tweets and the entities contained in them. For example, the tweet "I love iPhone, but I hate iPad" can be annotated with a mixed sentiment label, but the entity iPhone within this tweet should be annotated with a positive sentiment label. Aiming to overcome this limitation, and to complement current evaluation datasets, we present STS-Gold, a new evaluation dataset where tweets and targets (entities) are annotated individually and therefore may present different sentiment labels. This paper also provides a comparative study of the various datasets along several dimensions including: total number of tweets, vocabulary size and sparsity. We also investigate the pair-wise correlation among these dimensions as well as their correlations to the sentiment classification performance on different datasets.}

The Semantic Orientation CALculator (SO-CAL) uses dictionaries of words annotated with their semantic orientation (polarity and strength), and incorporates intensification and negation. SO-CAL is applied to the polarity classification task, the process of assigning a positive or negative label to a text that captures the text's opinion towards its main subject matter. We show that SO-CAL's performance is consistent across domains and in completely unseen data. Additionally, we describe the process of dictionary creation, and our use of Mechanical Turk to check dictionaries for consistency and reliability.},

In this paper, first from a message sender perspective, we focus on people’s motives in using four types of emojis — positive, neutral, negative, and non-facial. We compare the willingness levels of using these emoji types for seven typical intentions that people usually apply nonverbal cues for in communication. The results of extensive statistical hypothesis tests not only report the popularities of the intentions, but also uncover the subtle differences between emoji types in terms of intended uses. Second, from a perspective of message recipients, we further study the sentiment effects of emojis, as well as their duplications, on verbal messages. Different from previous studies in emoji sentiment, we study the sentiments of emojis and their contexts as a whole. The experiment results indicate that the powers of conveying sentiment are different between four emoji types, and the sentiment effects of emojis vary in the contexts of different valences. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Hu, Tianran and Guo, Han and Sun, Hao and Nguyen, Thuy-vy and Luo, Jiebo}, year={2017}, month={May}, pages={102-111} }
