abstract = {Sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment-related information from text. Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tasks, such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, RunnersWorld, BBCForums) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.},

To assess the performance of sentiment analysis methods over Twitter a small set of evaluation datasets have been released in the last few years. In this paper we present an overview of eight publicly available and manually annotated evaluation datasets for Twitter sentiment analysis. Based on this review, we show that a common limitation of most of these datasets, when assessing sentiment analysis at target (entity) level, is the lack of distinctive sentiment annotations among the tweets and the entities contained in them. For example, the tweet "I love iPhone, but I hate iPad" can be annotated with a mixed sentiment label, but the entity iPhone within this tweet should be annotated with a positive sentiment label. Aiming to overcome this limitation, and to complement current evaluation datasets, we present STS-Gold, a new evaluation dataset where tweets and targets (entities) are annotated individually and therefore may present different sentiment labels. This paper also provides a comparative study of the various datasets along several dimensions including: total number of tweets, vocabulary size and sparsity. We also investigate the pair-wise correlation among these dimensions as well as their correlations to the sentiment classification performance on different datasets.}

In this paper, first from a message sender perspective, we focus on people’s motives in using four types of emojis — positive, neutral, negative, and non-facial. We compare the willingness levels of using these emoji types for seven typical intentions that people usually apply nonverbal cues for in communication. The results of extensive statistical hypothesis tests not only report the popularities of the intentions, but also uncover the subtle differences between emoji types in terms of intended uses. Second, from a perspective of message recipients, we further study the sentiment effects of emojis, as well as their duplications, on verbal messages. Different from previous studies in emoji sentiment, we study the sentiments of emojis and their contexts as a whole. The experiment results indicate that the powers of conveying sentiment are different between four emoji types, and the sentiment effects of emojis vary in the contexts of different valences. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Hu, Tianran and Guo, Han and Sun, Hao and Nguyen, Thuy-vy and Luo, Jiebo}, year={2017}, month={May}, pages={102-111} }

One version, called multi-variate Bernoulli or binary independence model, uses binary word occurrence vectors, while the multinomial model uses word frequency counts. Many publications cite this difference as the main reason for the superior performance of the multinomial Naive Bayesclassifier. We argue that this is not true. We show that when all word frequency information is eliminated from the document vectors, the multinomial Naive Bayes model performs even better. Moreover, we argue that the main reason for the difference in performance is the way that negative evidence, i.e. evidence from words that do not occur in a document, is incorporated in the model. Therefore, this paper aims at a better understanding and a clarification of the difference between the two probabilistic models of Naive Bayes.",

Despite the fact that this last assumption might not be correct in many situations, we find that, in general, relaxing it does not change the performance of the classifier. Finally we propose and evaluate an ad-hoc method for incorporating document length.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of distribution of words and phrases in text, a problem of great general interest and of importance for many practical applications. The existing models for word distribution present observed sequences of words in text documents as an outcome of some stochastic processes; the corresponding distributions of numbers of word occurrences in the documents are modelled as mixtures of Poisson distributions whose parameter values are fitted to the data. We pursue a linguistically motivated approach to statistical language modelling and use observable text characteristics as model parameters. Multi-word technical terms, intrinsically content entities, are chosen for experimentation. Their occurrence and the occurrence dynamics are investigated using a 100-million word data collection consisting of a variety of about 13,000 technical documents. The derivation of models describing word distribution in text is based on a linguistic interpretation of the process of text formation, with the probabilities of word occurrence being functions of observable and linguistically meaningful text characteristics. The adequacy of the proposed models for the description of actually observed distributions of words and phrases in text is confirmed experimentally. The paper has two focuses: one is modelling of the distributions of content words and phrases among different documents; and another is word occurrence dynamics within documents and estimation of corresponding probabilities. Accordingly, among the application areas for the new modelling paradigm are information retrieval and speech recognition.},

Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.},

abstract = {The concept of Social Media is top of the agenda for many business executives today. Decision makers, as well as consultants, try to identify ways in which firms can make profitable use of applications such as Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, Second Life, and Twitter. Yet despite this interest, there seems to be very limited understanding of what the term “Social Media” exactly means; this article intends to provide some clarification. We begin by describing the concept of Social Media, and discuss how it differs from related concepts such as Web 2.0 and User Generated Content. Based on this definition, we then provide a classification of Social Media which groups applications currently subsumed under the generalized term into more specific categories by characteristic: collaborative projects, blogs, content communities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds. Finally, we present 10 pieces of advice for companies which decide to utilize Social Media.}
